This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It implements the coffee-varieties API at https://coffee-varieties.now.sh/api. 
It will fetch all the available coffee varieties, which can be filtered in the frontend of the application. The user can filter by one or more countries, quality potential anbd leaf rust resistance.

You will also see any (lint) errors in the console.

For this project, CI/CD is enabled. Every commit to the master on Github will trigger a build and deploy to Github Pages by means of GitHub Actions (if the repository is public, it is private at the moment).

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
